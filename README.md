Notes and Code Include Covered Topics:
- Variables: Variables are containers for storing data values. Python has no command for declaring a variable.
- Functions: Python Functions is a block of statements that return the specific task.
- Python Syntax: Python uses indentation to indicate a block of code and Python syntax can be executed by writing directly in the Command Line. 
- Python Data Types: Variables can store data of different types, and different types can do different things.
- Return Statement: The Python return statement marks the end of a function and specifies the value or values to pass back from the function. Return statements can return data of any type, including integers, floats, strings, lists, dictionaries, and even other functions.
- If Statement: the if statement is a conditional statement. It is used to execute a block of code only when a specific condition is met.
- Numbers: There are three numeric types in python: int, float, and complex.
- Classes and Object: Python is an object oriented programming language. Almost everything in Python is an object, with its properties and methods. A Class is like an object constructor, or a "blueprint" for creating objects. Objects are variables that contain data and functions that can be used to manipulate the data. Every Object belongs to it class. A Python object is essentially anything that you can assign to a variable. While a class is a code template for creating objects.

## Loops
- While Loops: A while loop is a control flow statement that allows code to be executed repeatedly as long as the boolean condition is met.
- For Loops: A for loop is used for iterating over a sequence. They work well for iterating over sequences (like lists, tuples, strings, or ranges) and performing an action for each element.
- Nested Loops: A for loop is used for iterating over a sequence

## Data Structures 
- Lists: A list is a data structure in Python that is a mutable, or changeable, ordered sequence of elements. Lists are used to store multiple items in a single variable.
- Dictionaries: Dictionaries are Pythonâ€™s implementation of a data structure that is more generally known as an associative array. A dictionary consists of a collection of key-value pairs. Each key-value pair maps the key to its associated value.
- Tuples: Tuples are used to store multiple items in a single variable. A tuple is a collection which is ordered, unchangeable, and allow duplicate values.
- 2D Lists: A list within another list is called 2-Dimensional (2D)
- Arrays: an array is used to store multiple values or elements of the same datatype in a single variable.
